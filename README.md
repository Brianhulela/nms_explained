# NMS Explained: Step-by-Step Guide with Python  

The notebook illustrates:  
- How multiple bounding box predictions arise in object detection models  
- The role of confidence scores and Intersection over Union (IoU)  
- A clear implementation of Non-Maximum Suppression in Python  
- Step-by-step visualizations showing how bounding boxes are filtered at different IoU thresholds  

The explanations combine **mathematics, visual examples, and Python code** to make NMS intuitive and practical for real-world use.
